Gives an approximate 1H NMR when given a smiles or a IUPAC name of a molecule with maximum one aromatic ring and no double bonds.

## üîß Installation

## 1. Fork the Repository

First, fork the repository to your own GitHub account. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

## 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the forked repository to your local machine: replace 'your-username' with your username.
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nmross.git
cd nmross
```

## 3. Create a Virtual Environment

Create a new virtual environment to keep your dependencies isolated: and activate the environment.
```
conda create -n nmross python=3.10
conda activate nmross
```

## 4. Install the Package Locally

With the virtual environment activated, install the package locally using 'pip install .': this installs the package that are in the current folder so make sure you are in the environment nmross.
```
pip install .
```
## 5. Install JupyterLab 

Install jupyter lab in the nmross environment. You can launch jupyter lab by copying the second line.

```
pip install jupyter lab
jupyter lab
```



## üî• Usage

```python
from mypackage import main_func

# One line to rule them all
result = main_func(data)
```

This usage example shows how to quickly leverage the package's main functionality with just one line of code (or a few lines of code). 
After importing the `main_func` (to be renamed by you), you simply pass in your `data` and get the `result` (this is just an example, your package might have other inputs and outputs). 
Short and sweet, but the real power lies in the detailed documentation.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Installation

Create a new environment, you may also give the environment a different name. 

```
conda create -n nmross python=3.10 
```

```
conda activate nmross
(conda_env) $ pip install .
```

If you need jupyter lab, install it 

```
(nmross) $ pip install jupyterlab
```


## üõ†Ô∏è Development installation

Initialize Git (only for the first time). 

Note: You should have create an empty repository on `https://github.com:CedricRossboth/nmross`.

```
git init
git add * 
git add .*
git commit -m "Initial commit" 
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:CedricRossboth/nmross.git 
git push -u origin main
```

Then add and commit changes as usual. 

To install the package, run

```
(nmross) $ pip install -e ".[test,doc]"
```

### Run tests and coverage

```
(conda_env) $ pip install tox
(conda_env) $ tox
```
